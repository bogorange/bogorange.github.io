<h1> My Favorite Music</h1>
<p class="genre"> I love music but I wouldn't say I have a favorite genre, but I really enjoy anything that is adjacent to rock. Right now I've been listening to <em>Nonagon Infinity</em> by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. They fit into a lot of genres but the most interesting one to me is <strong> psychedelic rock</strong>.</p>
<p class="artist"> My favorite artist would probably be Mitski. I relate to a lot of what she writes in her music. I even saw her in <strong> concert!!!!</strong> <span>She is truly an amazing performer. </span></p>

<p class="contact">Here is a link to her <a href='https://mitski.com' target='_blank'>website.</a> If you ever want to talk about or recommend music,</p>
